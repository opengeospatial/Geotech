=== Introduction to FROST

The FRaunhofer Opensource SensorThings-Server (FROST) is an
implementation of the
<<Introduction-to-SensorThingsAPI-data-model,OGC SensorThings API>>. It can be deployed as a Docker image, or directly on
an existing Tomcat or similar server. Since version 2 it has a flexible
data model implementation that allows the data model to be extended or
even completely replaced with little effort. This makes FROST an ideal
platform for data model experiments.

For the GeoTech IE, a plugin has been made for FROST that extends the STA
core data model with extra entities. See
<<FROST-Plugin-for-Geotech,FROST plugin for Geotech>>.
