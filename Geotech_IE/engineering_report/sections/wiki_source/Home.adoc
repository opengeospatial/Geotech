=== Motivation

BIM, GIS & Digital Twins introduce or emphasize several requirements
regarding the data. This mostly concern the built environment but also
orientate the way the geoscience data are expected to be delivered.

==== Semantic coherence for Geotechnics and the necessity of models federation

The main concern is about semantics. As also identified as the main
criteria of interoperability in the FAIR principles, data shall be
described in a non-ambiguous way. Those definitions shall be shared by
the community independently from the standard that is used. For that
purpose, a federation of model is needed. Then OGC and bSI will derive
logical models for OGC based and bSI based (IFC) standards.

*_This effort would fit into the ongoing collaboration between OGC
initiatives and bSI projects on georeferencing, infrastructures
alignments, procedural geometries, voxels, etcâ€¦_*

Although, this project is the opportunity to align with other standards.
A non-exhaustive list of them include AGS/AGSi, DIGGS, Geo3DML,
GeoValML, BoreholeML, ResqML, etc.

On the OGC side, this project is identified as the main contributor to
leverage the OGC based standards. For the moment, the IFC schema
extension for Geotechnics is mainly supported by the GeoSubgroup of the
IFC Tunnel but it aims to serve all the IFC infrastructure projects.
