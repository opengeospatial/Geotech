==== Play with the FROST Geotech plugin

The SensorThings API has very powerful query features that keep easy
things easy, but still allow very complex requests. A good starting
explanation on how to query the SensorThings API can be found at the
https://fraunhoferiosb.github.io/FROST-Server/sensorthingsapi/3_GettingData.html[Getting
Data] section on the FROST-Documentation website.

This page is about relevant queries you may do with the FROST Geotech
plugin

===== Simple queries

====== Lists

The simplest queries are those that fetch a list of all entities of a
type. For instance, getting a list of all the geotechTests (Mapped to
Sensor in STA):Â 

....
https://[FrostGeotechServerAddress]/v1.1/Sensors
....

Or to get all borehole collars:

....
https://[FrostGeotechServerAddress]/v1.1/BhCollarThings
....

====== Single Entities

To get a single entity from a list, add `+(<id>)+` to the URL of the
list. To get the geoTechTest (Sensor) with id `+1+`:

....
https://[FrostGeotechServerAddress]/v1.1/Sensors(1)
....

Or to get the borehole collar with id `+42+`:

....
https://[FrostGeotechServerAddress]/v1.1/BhCollarThings(42)
....

====== Related Lists

To get a list of entities related to a certain entity, one can navigate
along relations. for instance, to get all Datastreams for Sensor
(geoTechTest) with id `+1+`:

....
https://[FrostGeotechServerAddress]/v1.1/Sensors(1)/Datastreams
....

Or to get the Trajectories related to borehole collar `+1+`:

....
https://[FrostGeotechServerAddress]/v1.1/BhCollarThings(1)/BhTrajectoryThings
....

Or to get the Datastreams related to a Trajectory `+1+`:

....
https://[FrostGeotechServerAddress]/v1.1/BhTrajectoryThings(1)/Datastreams
....

And from there, to get the Observations related to a Datastream `+1+`:

....
https://[FrostGeotechServerAddress]/v1.1/Datastreams(1)/Observations
....

====== Filtering Lists

All lists can be filtered using the filter parameter.
To get a list of all the geotechTests that are of type CPT (sensorType `https://data.geoscience.fr/ncl/Proc/86`):
....
https://[FrostGeotechServerAddress]/v1.1/Sensors?]filter=sensortype eq
'`https://data.geoscience.fr/ncl/Proc/86`'

....


===== More complex queries

Get the results of the available DataStreams associated to my Geotechtest organised this way : (Depth, Result for property 1, Result for property 2, ...)
....

https://ogc-demo.k8s.ilt-dmz.iosb.fraunhofer.de/FROST-GeoTech/v1.1/BhTrajectoryThings(9)?
$select=name& $expand=BhSamplings( $orderBy=atPosition;
$select=atPosition,time; $expand=BhSamples( $top=1; $select=name;
$expand=Observations( $top=3; $select=result,phenomenonTime;
$expand=Datastream( $select=unitOfMeasurement; $expand=ObservedProperty(
$select=name ) ) ) ) )

....

Get this same result in csv
....

_Currently not possible unfortunately, but plans to add this functionality are in place._

....

Get the CPT tests in this perimeter that match this lithology (Rock)

Given that BhTrajectoryThings(9) is the trajectory with the CPT test:
....

https://ogc-demo.k8s.ilt-dmz.iosb.fraunhofer.de/FROST-GeoTech/v1.1/BhTrajectoryThings(9)/BhSamplings?
$filter=BhTrajectoryThing/BhCollarThing/RelatedBhCollarThings/BhTrajectoryThings/BhSamplings/BhSamples/Observations/result
eq '`Rock`' and atPosition gt
BhTrajectoryThing/BhCollarThing/RelatedBhCollarThings/BhTrajectoryThings/BhSamplings/fromPosition
and atPosition lt
BhTrajectoryThing/BhCollarThing/RelatedBhCollarThings/BhTrajectoryThings/BhSamplings/toPosition

....

Get the results of those same CPT tests
....

https://ogc-demo.k8s.ilt-dmz.iosb.fraunhofer.de/FROST-GeoTech/v1.1/BhTrajectoryThings(9)/BhSamplings?
$filter=BhTrajectoryThing/BhCollarThing/RelatedBhCollarThings/BhTrajectoryThings/BhSamplings/BhSamples/Observations/result
eq '`Rock`' and atPosition gt
BhTrajectoryThing/BhCollarThing/RelatedBhCollarThings/BhTrajectoryThings/BhSamplings/fromPosition
and atPosition lt
BhTrajectoryThing/BhCollarThing/RelatedBhCollarThings/BhTrajectoryThings/BhSamplings/toPosition&
latexmath:[expand=BhSamples(]expand=Observations) ```
