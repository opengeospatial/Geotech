=== About implementation

Implementation is the state where concepts and ideas take a more
concrete shape.

In data modeling, this means tools and technical solutions are provided
in order to realize the conceptual model. Therefore implementation then
participate in the validation of the conceptual model and of course
enable to truly provide data (here geotech) in an interoperable way.

One must distinguish the capacity of exposing:

* vocabularies, codelists, or
* observations, measurements, and features description.

The GeotechIE experimented with some OGC APIs to provide geotech data:
