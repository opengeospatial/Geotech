[[GeotechTypicalSection]]
==== GeotechTypicalSection

Interval along the alignment/building structure with similar ground
conditions, as part of the link:GeotechSynthesisModel[GeotechSynthesis
model] that represents the connection between the ground model and the
building. Includes key-properties like expected distribution of ground
types (reference to GeotechUnits) and baseline-definition of expected
ground conditions and potential hazards, and may also include
key-information on design like excavation measures, distribution of
support types etc.

|OGC LandInfra |FacilityPart |Land and Infrastructure facility, such as
a road or bridge. A facility has a life cycle, including planning,
design, construction, maintenance, operation, and removal phases The
design and construction phases are typically performed as part of a
project. There may be multiple such projects during the life cycle of
the facility to enable phased construction and incremental improvement.

|ISO 19148 |FeatureEvent |The FeatureEvent interface is used to linearly
reference a feature along a LinearElement and possibly further qualified
as applying at an instant in, or during a period of, time.

Note: the GeotechTypicalSection can be seen on different aspect and then
have multiple realizations: - a part of a tunnel (a part of a facility)
- an event along an alignment.
