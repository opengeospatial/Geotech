=== Book B Principles

In their tentative to appreciate the environment of a projected
infrastructure, geotechnical engineers pay attention to several aspects:

* Geology, 
* HydroGeology, 
* Geotechnics, 
* Surrounding constructions,
* Geohazards, and
* Environmental impact (polluted site).

Models are built in order to reflect an understanding of this
environment.

Each Book B ends with a register of uncertainties: what is known, what is
unknown.

==== Concepts list

The Book B is organized in Geomodels which themselves are components of
different Features based on their thematic content.

==== Primary models and their components

The following components are included in geology, hydrogeology, and geotechnics models.

* Geomodel
* GeologicUnit
* Fault
* Contact
* Fold
* HydroGeoUnit
* FluidBody
* FluidBodySurface
* GeotechUnit
* DiscreteDiscontinuity
* Void
* HazardArea
* SurroundingConstruction
