==== HydrogeoUnit

____
These are distinct volumes of earth material that serve as containers
for subsurface fluids. The boundaries of a unit are typically
discriminated from those of another unit using properties related to the
potential or actual ability to contain or move water. The properties can
be geological or hydraulic, and typically include influences from the
surrounding hydrological environment. More specifically, the conceptual
model delineates two types of hydrogeological units, with slightly
different orientations: aquifer-related units have boundaries delimited
by the hydrogeological properties of the rock body, while groundwater
basins have boundaries delimited by distinct flow regimes.
Aquifer-related units are subdivided into aquifer systems, which are
collections of aquifers, confining beds, and other aquifer systems.
Confining beds are units that impede water flow to surrounding units,
and supersede notions such as aquitards, aquicludes, and aquifuges,
which are not included herein, as it is difficult to differentiate these
in practice.
