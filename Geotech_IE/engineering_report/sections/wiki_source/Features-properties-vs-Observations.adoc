==== The distinction between feature properties and observations.

===== Definitions

A video introduction by Kathi Schleidt of the observation concept can be
found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYDSgs2fKLk

It notably proposes an explanation of what is an observation vs a
property of a feature. The picture below makes it clear.

*Feature property*: one object called the feature (here the smily face) is
identified and is associated to a property (here Expression = Happy)

*Observation*: a dedicated object called the observation is set. It is
more exactly an act which itself have some properties that enable to
define the context and also the result of the observation act (here that
the Smily Face looks to be of a yellow color according to Kathyâ€™s
experience).

===== Feature properties vs observations

Feature properties are a direct way to associate an information to an
object. The association is "`absolute`" in the sense that it is always
true, no matter when, who/what is involved in describing the object. For
example, the name of a person, its date of birth.

On the contrary, the observation concept offer the capacity to
contextualize an information that is provided. For example, the time,
the location, the method, the observer: that is to say conditions in
which the information was obtained and may have an important impact on
the validity of the result.

For those reasons one can see that:

* feature properties perfectly fit domain where the knowledge of the
objects are well mastered. This is typically the case in *industry* that
propose to build from hand or machine made well known components.
* observation is very relevant in domain where the knowledge is
incomplete, or when only a small part (either in terms of space or time)
of an object is studied. This is typically the case in *science* where
each information must be kept in its context before (possibly) deducting
a more general law or rule.

===== When to use one or the other in geotechnics

Information obtained through a process of observation, measurement,
interpretation or even calculus fit the concept of observation and shall
be exposed that way.

===== How to associate observations to features?

A basic need for semanticized objects is to be able to associate them with
information.

*Approach 1: (Direct) Feature properties, as in GeoSciML Lite*

.In this simplified version of GeoSciML, a direct association between the "`ObservedProperty`" and the "`Result`" is provided.

*Approach 2: Association of one ObservedProperty to a Measurement, as in GroundWaterML2*

.Here the gwUnitThickness of the GL_GeologicUnit is intended to be provided as a Measurement, following ISO19156.

To realize this association, the "`ObservedProperty`" shall be
associated to the identifier of a Measurement Object. A clean way to do
that is to have the measurement exposed through an link:OGC%20APIs[OGC
API] and use the link to it.

The picture below illustrates measurement with a link to a WFS service.

*Approach 3 : Association to an OGC API*

A drawback of the second approach is that one needs to have all the
ObservedProperties described in the feature and to associate the results
one by one.

A solution to avoid this constraint is to directly associate the feature
to an "`Observation Oriented API`" that will list the available
observations associated to the feature.

The following request to an
<<Introduction-to-SensorThingsAPI-data-model[OGC SensorThingsAPI]>>
enable to list the "`DataStreams`", that is to say collection of
observations associated to the Object of interest (here a borehole or
BhTrajectoryThing):

This is the preferred approach for this IE.
