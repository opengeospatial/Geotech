[[Extending-gwml2-HydroGeoVoid]]
==== HydroGeoVoid according to GroundWaterML2

From https://docs.ogc.org/is/19-013/19-013.html#toc40[GroundwaterML2]:

____
Voids represent the spaces inside (hosted by) a unit or its material.
E.g., the pores in an aquifer, or in the sandstone of an aquifer. Voids
can contain fluid bodies. Voids are differentiated from '`porosity`' in
that porosity is the proportion of void volume to total volume, while
voids are the spaces themselves. Voids are required in GWML2, for
example, to capture the volume of fractures in an aquifer.

===== Geotech concept that can use gwml2:HydroGeoVoid

gwml2:HydroGeoVoid is identified to realize the geotech concept called
<<Void,Void>>.

The name HydroGeoVoid makes it very hydrogeology oriented, yet the
definition is generic enough for the geotech purpose.

For man made voids (e.g., tunnels, gallery) the concept of Facility from
LandInfra may also be used.
