[[STA-Borehole-Model]]
==== STA Borehole Model

Based on the Conceptual Borehole Model, a physical STA-based model has
been derived. In the diagram below, you see both the core STA data model
as well as the various extensions proposed for the GeoTech IE.

In order to understand how this physical model has been created from the
Conceptual Borehole Model, the following diagram sets the STA classes
into their conceptual context, indicating which STA classes realize
which classes from the Conceptual Borehole Model.
