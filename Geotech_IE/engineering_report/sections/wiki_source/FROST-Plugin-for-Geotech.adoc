=== FROST Plugin for geotech
==== A short intro to the OGC SensorThingsAPI data model

For those who are not (yet) familiar with the data model from the OGC
SensorThings API, please visit:
link:Introduction-to-SensorThingsAPI-data-model[Introduction to
SensorThingsAPI data model].

==== Extending STA for Geotech

Thanks to the DataStream concept, that is part of the core STA data
model, STA is very suited for use cases where repeated observations and
measurements are made. The support for time series is native and is the
essence of STA. When it comes to address measurements along a
trajectory, STA functions similarly to a time series, except the
variable is space and not time.

In practice, measurements along a trajectory within a borehole are a
kind of time series because the results are obtained one after the other
as the hole is advanced. The difference is that the time parameter is
not important whereas the location parameter is the important domain for
the measurement.

===== Extended data model

To improve the support for boreholes, the core SensorThings data model
has been extended. The conceptual background of this extension is
explained in <<STA-Borehole-Model,STA Borehole Model>>. This data model extension has been implemented as a
FROST-Server plugin, together with a security extension that allows
fine-grained access control to borehole data:

===== Map geotech data to the STA data model

*Test (geotechnical in-situ)*

Act (Sensor) carried out as part of a (Project)

Associated with a borehole (BhCollarThing) that follows a trajectory
(BhTrajectoryThing)

*Observation / observation group*

Obtained during a test (Sensor)

One or more parameter value(s) (ObservedProperty) measured at a given
location (FeatureOfInterest)

These given locations are defined by sampling (BhSampling) along the
trajectory (BhTrajectoryThing)

===== Geotech data considered

This implementation is for delivering observations & measurements (aka
Book A data. See: <<Book-A-organization-and-components>> for more details).

The study mainly focused on in-situ tests, including:

* Cone Penetration Test (CPT),
* Standard Penetration Test (SPT),
* Menard Pressuremeter Test.

It also addresses laboratory tests, including discussions about:

* Atterberg limits test.

===== Download FROST GeoTech plugin

The FROST GeoTech plugin, with installation help, can be found at the
https://github.com/hylkevds/FROST-Server.Plugin.GeoTech/[FROST GeoTech
Plugin] GitHub page. The plugin can be used as a docker image. An
https://github.com/hylkevds/FROST-Server.Plugin.GeoTech/blob/main/scripts/docker-compose.yaml[example
DockerCompse file] is provided with the plugin. To try it out without
installing anything, a demo service is available at:
https://ogc-demo.k8s.ilt-dmz.iosb.fraunhofer.de/FROST-GeoTech/v1.1/ (use
username/password read/read for read-only access)

===== Entity creation order

Since some entities in the data model require other entities, like the
Datastream requiring a Thing, there is a certain order in which these
entities should be created. The general order is:

. FeatureType (re-used often)
. ObservedProperty (re-used often)
. BhCollarThing + Location
. BhTrajectoryThing + Location
. BhSampler + BhSamplingProcedure (if present)
. BhSampling
. BhFeatureOfInterest
. BhPreparationProcedure (if present)
. BhPreparationStep (if present)
. Sensor
. Datastream
. Observation

There are some things to take into account when populating the data
model.

* The FeatureTypes and ObservedProperties are re-used often, and
should only be created once per server.
* Things and FeaturesOfInterest
are not directly created in the GeoTech data model extension. These
entities are automatically populated from the BhCollarThing,
BhTrajectoryThing and BhFeatureOfInterest.
* A Datastream is linked to
either a BhCollarThing or a BhTrajectoryThing, but not to both.
* When creating an Observation, the id of the BhFeatureOfInterest should be
given as FeatureOfInterest, otherwise FROST will try to generate a
FeatureOfInterest, and fail. For example:
`+{     "phenomenonTime": "2017-12-31T23:00:00.000Z/2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",     "result": 12.6,     "Datastream": {         "@iot.id": 42     },     "FeatureOfInterest": {         "@iot.id": 99     }   }+`

A https://github.com/hylkevds/FROST-Server.Plugin.GeoTech/blob/main/scripts/BatchUploadTemplate.json[demonstration
Batch Request] is available that creates examples of all entity types,
with their relations, in the correct order.

===== Security Extension

The security extension that is part of the FROST GeoTech Plugin adds
powerful project-management related access control features. The
extension adds four extra EntityTypes to the data model:

* User
* Role
* Project
* UserProjectRole

The `+User+` entities represent users of the system. When combined with
the BasicAuth authentication plugin (the Default in the docker image)
users must be explicitly created with a username and a password. When
combined with the KeyCloak plugin, User entities are automatically
created, and don’t have a password field. The password field can not be
read by anyone, not even global admins.

The `+Project+` entities represent a unit of management that ties Users
in one or more Roles to Entities. Projects are directly linked to
Sensors and Things. All other entities in the data model are indirectly
linked to Projects through a Thing. For instance, Observations belong to
the Project of the Thing of their Datastream (Project -> Thing ->
Datastream -> Observation) and BhFeaturesOfInterest are linked to a
Project through the Sampling (Project -> BhTrajectoryThing -> BhSampling
-> BhFeatureOfInterest). ObservedProperties are shared among all
Projects and can only be created or modified by a global server admin.
Finally, Projects can be either public or private through the property
`+public+`. If the `+public+` property of a Project is true, then all
users of the system can read entities associated to the Project. If the
`+public+` property is false, then only Users that have the `+read+`
right on that Project, or have global `+read+` rights, can read
Observations associated with that Project.

The `+Role+` entities represent rights that a User can have. Roles can
be directly linked to a User, or indirectly through a UserProjectRole
Entity for a given Project. Roles that are directly connected to a User
apply to the entire service. Roles that are linked to a user for a
Project only apply to Entites of that Project. For instance, a User that
has the global Role `+update+` can modify all Entities in the service. A
user that has the `+update+` role for a given Project can only modify
those Entities that are related to that specific Project.

A UserProjectRole entity gives a User a certain Role within a certain
Project.

A normal user can only read the `+User+` Entity that belongs to their
user account. Users that have a project role of `+admin+` can read all
User entities, since a project admin must be able to add Users to their
Project. The password of a user (when BasicAuth is used) can only be
changed by the User themselves, or by a global admin.

The rights for the different user types:

|===

* The admin user type has global Admin, Create, Read, Update and Delete
rights.
* The Geotech Expert user type has global Create, Read, Update and
Delete rights, and can thus create Observed Properties and access all
data in the server, but not manage users.
* The Project user types do not have any global roles, only
project-related roles.
