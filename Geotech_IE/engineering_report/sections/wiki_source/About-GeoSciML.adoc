==== Introduction to GeoSciML

From the https://cgi-iugs.org/project/geosciml/[CGI-IUGS website]:

____
*GeoSciML* is an XMLâ€“based data transfer standard for the exchange of
digital geoscientific information. It accommodates the representation
and description of features typically found on geological maps, as well
as being extensible to other geoscience data such as drilling, sampling,
and analytical data. *GeoSciML* provides a standard data structure for a
suite of common geologic features (eg, geologic units, structures, earth
materials) and artifacts of geological investigations (e.g., boreholes,
specimens, measurements). Supporting objects such as the geologic
timescale and vocabularies are also provided as linked resources, so
that they can be used as classifiers for the primary objects in the
GeoSciML standard.

The latest version of the specifications of that joint CGI-IUGS and OGC
standard can be found here: https://docs.ogc.org/is/16-008/16-008.html
