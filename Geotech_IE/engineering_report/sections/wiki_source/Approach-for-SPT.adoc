[[Approach-for-SPT]]
==== Approach for SPT

The Standard Penetration Test (SPT) is a very widely used in-situ
geotechnical test often applied in combination with other tests during
the advance of a borehole by various rotary drilling techniques. The
boreholes may also be advanced by sonic or direct push techniques, but
these are far less common. The test is typically conducted at discrete
intervals following separate drilling operations.

The test is valued for its ability to retrieve a sample and a
simultaneous measurement of soil strength, as well as its relatively low
cost, simple test protocol, wide-availability, and compact data set
which can be easily manually recorded and transmitted. The sampler is
relatively robust and can be used in nearly any geo-environment: soft to
hard soils, cemented soils, regional geomaterials, urban fill, and soft
rock.

The test is commonly used to evaluate the strength of soils through
correlations to the angle of internal friction of granular materials and
soil relative density. Over the decades of use of SPT, researchers have
also amassed correlations to most every commonly used engineering
parameter, with variable reliability, precision, and accuracy. Caution
is advised when making interpretations about strength and other
behaviors in environments where the test is not well suited, as
described in governing standard test methods and other manuals of
practice. While the SPT can collect samples in most materials it is not
well suited to determining material strength properties of complex
geotechnical materials such as peats, clays, and relatively large
aggregates (as compared to the sampler size).

The SPT test is typically conducted across an interval of 18-inches [450
mm], creating a measurement associated with that sample length.
Extremely soft or extremely hard materials may influence the test
interval and measurement reporting. While back-to-back (continuous) SPT
sampling is possible, the test is commonly conducted at intervals
specified by the owner or agency. Often 2.5 ft., 5 ft., or 10 ft.
intervals (or SI equivalent) during the advance of a borehole and is
typically conducted at increasingly wider intervals as borings advance
deeper owing to the need to alternate the drilling bit or tools with the
sampler by pulling the complete string of drilling rods in and out of
the hole.

The SPT test is considered a "`disturbed sample`" test as the sampler
has a comparatively narrow aperture to collect the sample and thick
outer wall. The basic mechanics of the test involve driving the soil
sampler, at the base of the drill string, through the ground by a series
of dynamic hammer drops applied to the top of the drill rods. The number
of blows taken to drive the rods in measured depth intervals is
recorded.

A variety of hammers and hammer systems can be used. Mechanical trip
hammers, donut hammers, winch hammers, and safety hammers are in use
worldwide. The test method prescribes a weight of 140 lbs [63.5 kg] and
a drop height of 30 inches [750 mm]. Some hammer systems, such as rope
and cathead hammers are operatory dependent and energy can vary widely.
For improved performance and consistency, hammer systems should be
calibrated to determine the energy transfer ratio (ETR), with the energy
reported on boring logs for use in design [this is optional in the US
standard].

For a typical test, a boring is advanced to the desired test depth (or
elevation). The drilling tooling is pulled from the hole and the drill
bit replaced with the SPT sampler. The sampler is lowered back into the
borehole and the test begins. The top of the drill rod is marked off in
three (3) 6-inch [750 mm] increments. The test consists of recording the
number of blows to advance the sampler in each of three (3) consecutive
6-inch [150 mm] intervals. The sample tube is driven the first 6-inches
and the number of blows needed to penetrate that interval is recorded.
The procedure similarly repeats for the second 6-inch [150 mm] and third
6-inch [150 mm] intervals. After the sampler has advanced to a depth of
18-inches [450 mm] the test concludes. The three penetration "`blow`"
numbers are recorded. A calculated value, the sum of the number of blows
associated with the second 6-inch [150 mm] and third 6-inch [150 mm]
intervals is reported as the "`standard penetration resistance`",
"`N-value`" or "`SPT blow count`"

Notably, there are a number of "`special cases`" where the N-value may
be unusual. If the sampler is driven less than the full extent the
number of blows for each full increment or partial increment is
recorded. The number of blows in a given increment are counted until a
test termination condition is reached:

* The sampler penetrates 6 inches (150 mm);
* The sampler is driven 50 blows in any of the 3 increments;
* The sampler is driven a total of 100 blows; or
* The sampler does not advance after 10 consecutive blows.

Additionally, if the sampler advances under the weight of the sampler
and rods (or the sampler, rods, and hammer assembly) conditions of
"`weight of rods`" or "`weight of hammer`" are noted rather than a
"`N-value.`"

An additional component of the test is the "`Sample Recovery`" which is
a visual observation and manual measurement of the sample recovered in
the SPT sampler once the sampler is brought to the ground surface for
recovery of the obtained sample within the SPT sampler.

A variety of metadata is required by the US and other standards.
Applicable standards also specify the minimum precision associated with
the reported values among other aspects of the testing procedures and
equipment. Basic measurement output from a SPT test includes:

Basic measurement output from a SPT test includes:

* Depth of each test
location along the extent of the borehole [measured by the operator
based on the amount of drilling tooling in the ground and the ground
elevation],
* The increment blow values of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd
increments, in addition to any special notations associated, such as the
distance penetrated if less than 6-inches [150 mm]
* Notations if any of
the termination criteria are reached other than penetration or if the
sampler advances under the weight of rods or hammer
* The % recovery of
each sample within the SPT sampler
* Other driller notations such as
equipment and tooling, method of keeping the borehole open, depth of the
water surface, size of casing, hammer systems used, etc.

In addition, the calculated N-value is the primary output from the test:

* The "`standard penetration resistance`", "`N-value`" is calculated as
the sum of the number of blows associated with the second 6-inch [150
mm] and third 6-inch [150 mm] intervals.
* If the sampler is driven less than 18-inches [450 mm], the number of
blows per each complete 6-inch [150 mm] increment and each partial
increment is recorded. In this circumstance there is not an N-value
associated with that depth.

The N-value is often reported along with a calculated value, N60, where
the measured N-value is adjusted to a 60% drill rod energy transfer
ratio. Depending on owner and agency test procedures, SPT measurements
can further be corrected prior to their use in engineering calculations
based on a variety of variables. Corrections may be applied based on:

* Rod type (A rod vs.Â N rod)
* Use of liners within the SPT sampler
* Short rod lengths
* Boring diameter
* Other factors

The SPT measurements (N-value or other partial penetration and blow
measurements) are often recorded in the field on a boring log in a
discrete column of data. This information is then supplemented with
other field or lab data which may include the drilling operations, soil
type by observation or identification or classification system
evaluation techniques, and frequently moisture content evaluated from a
portion of the sample recovered in the soil sampler. SPT measurements
are commonly reported and associated on a boring log with other
depth-based data at the same location:

* Soil moisture contents
* % sample recovery
* A text-based soil identification or classification value derived from
the sample
* Symbology associated with a soil identification or classification
* A drilling operation (casing, plug drilling, etc.)

A challenge for this common test is that while the basic data is often
relatively simple and concise, there are a large number of supporting
informational elements either associated with the site, the borehole, or
the test. Many of these details are required by the test standard in the
report for a proper and complete understanding of the measurement data.

Driller and lab technician comments can be important to interpreting
otherwise unusual values, when compared with other in-situ tests or
laboratory tests on collected samples conducted in association with the
SPT testing. As such, the numeric measurements associated with the SPT
test are frequently associated with supplemental text-based notes and
comments, which may not be consistent among organizations, drilling
staff, or even an individual driller.

To demonstrate how the final results, interim test information and
related metadata are stored and organized within the FROST server, we
offer the following example SPT test for a single test interval.

_Note: This example focuses only on the in-situ test procedure and its
results; it does not provide any information regarding the recording of
any material samples that may have been recovered as a result of the
test. Use of the FROST plug-in for recording material sample information
is discussed in
<<Approach-for-Atterberg-Limits,Approach for Atterberg limits>>_

===== Instance Diagram

Object instances and the associations required to properly expose the
example test data with the FROST Geotech Plug-in are shown in the
following object diagram:

.SPT Example
image::https://github.com/opengeospatial/Geotech/assets/11915304/c08a1388-b710-42e4-b039-f18b6e01fe07[link="https://umltool.ogc.org/index.php?m=7&o=2BF8B0EC-8F8F-435d-820E-561D6921C4EF"]

The following summarizes the various entities in the diagram:

====== Sensor

The Sensor object serves as the observing procedure in STA. One object
instance is needed for this example (top center of diagram), and in this
example holds the information about the test procedure, test parameters,
equipment used and other metadata about the test. In this example, the
hammer information and hammer efficiency data would be held in the
properties object of the Sensor. One Sensor instance is needed for all
SPT tests conducted in one or more boreholes provided that the same
procedure, test parameters and test equipment is used for all tests.

====== ObservedProperty

The ObservedProperty object instances identify the properties that are
observed by the SPT test. There are 5 ObservedProperty instances (top of
diagram, below Sensor):

*two properties observed that constitute the final reported summary results of the test:*

[arabic]
. n_value (standard penetration resistance)

[arabic, start=2]
. n1_60 (standard penetration resistance corrected for hammer energy and
overburden conditions

*three properties observed as the test is being run*

[arabic, start=3]
. driveSetIndex (a counter for each set of hammer blows to drive the rod
150 cm)

[arabic, start=4]
. blowCount (number of blows during the drive set (increment)

[arabic, start=5]
. penetration (the distance the sampler travels during the drive set.

As with Sensor, the ObservedProperty instances can be reused for
multiple tests.

====== DataStream

All of the object instances in the diagram are linked to the Sensor and
ObservedProperty instances via Datastream instances (below the
ObservedProperty objects on the diagram), which serve to associate
observation results obtained from a feature of interest to its observed
property, observing procedure, and the borehole.

Five Datastream instances are needed, one for each ObservedProperty
instance.

====== BhCollarThing, BhTrajectoryThing and Location

The DataStreams all link to the borehole via its BhTrajectoryThing
object instance. BhTrajectoryThing (left edge of diagram) represents the
boreholeâs geometry and contains the borehole length and information for
linear referencing. The trajectoryâs geometry is given in the associated
Location instance. BhTrajectoryThing is associated with a BhCollarThing
instance, which represents the borehole as a whole. All general metadata
about the borehole is contained in the BhCollarThing object instance;
itâs geometry is represented by a point Location object instance.

More detail about properties of BhCollarThing and BhTrajectoryThing can
be found in the <<Approach-for-Borehole-logs,Borehole log discussion>>.

====== BhSampling and BhFeatureOfInterest

Sampling in the context of an SPT test or any in-situ test is the act of
observing properties in a segment of the hole. The single BhSampling
object instance (below and to the right of the BhTrajectoryThing in the
diagram) holds the depth information of the test run (fromPosition=1.5,
toPosition=3) and links to BhTrajectoryThing in order to affix the
linear referenced sampling positions to the trajectory geometry.

BhSampling produces a BhFeatureOfInterest object, which represents the
sampling location within the borehole (below the BhSampling object
instance in the diagram).

====== Observation

The remaining entities on the diagram are Observation instances that
provide the results for their associated observed properties. Each
Observation instance links to the BhFeatureOfInterest (sampling
location) and to the Datastream instance associated with the appropriate
ObservedProperty.

This SPT test consists of 11 individual observations. Two of them
(results for n_value and n1_60) are reported summary results that derive
from the driveSet (blowCount and penetration) results that are observed
directly during the test. The links shown in the diagram that relate
observations to each other provide the means for distinguishing between
the driveSet and summary/derived results.

Each driveSet increment is a set of three observation results. These
results are useless independently - for example, the blowCount in a
driveSet has no meaning without the associated penetration result for
that drivesetIndex, and vice versa. To model the driveSet, the
driveSetIntex result is linked to its associated blowCount and
penetration results, and the blowCount result is linked to its
associated penetration result. These three observations, as a set,
contribute to the determination of the final n_value result, and to
model that association, the driveSetIndex observations are linked to the
n-value observation. In this way, one can traverse from the n_value
observation to access those blow count and penetration observations that
contributed to the n_value result.

Finally, the n1_60 observation instance is linked to the n_value
observation instance to demonstrate that the n1_60 result relies on
n_value.

To provide the most flexibility for querying, Datastream object
instances associated with the Observations are linked in the same manner
as their associated Observations, as seen in the diagram.

The current STA model does not provide for one-way links where an
association role can be assigned. Such capability would be useful in
modeling evem more complex geotechnical test results.
