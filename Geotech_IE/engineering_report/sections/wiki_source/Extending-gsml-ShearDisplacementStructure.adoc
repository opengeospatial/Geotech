[[Extending-gsml-ShearDisplacementStructure]]
==== ShearDisplacementStructure according to GeoSciML

From https://docs.ogc.org/is/16-008/16-008.html#93[GeoSciML v4.1]:

____
A *shear displacement structure* includes all brittle to ductile style
structures along which displacement has occurred, from a simple, single
'`planar`' brittle or ductile surface to a fault system comprised of
tens of strands of both brittle and ductile nature. This structure may
have some significant thickness (a deformation zone) and have an
associated body of deformed rock that may be considered a deformation
unit (which geologicUnitType is '`DeformationUnit`') which can be
associated to the *ShearDisplacementStructure* using
GeologicFeatureRelation from the GeoSciML Extension package (8.5.1.2).
____

===== Geotech concept that can use gsml:ShearDisplacementStructure

gsml:ShearDisplacementStructure is identified to realize the geotech
concept called
<<Fault,Fault>>.
