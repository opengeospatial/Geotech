== Abstract

// Insert abstract content
This Engineering Report (ER) describes the outcomes of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Geotech Interoperability Experiment (IE). The objective of this IE was to develop a common conceptual model for describing geotechnical engineering data that bridges existing specifications for encoding those data and which could be integrated across OGC and buildingSMART International Standards,

This ER is directly imported from the project wiki found here: https://github.com/opengeospatial/Geotech/wiki.
