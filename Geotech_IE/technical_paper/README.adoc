= Technical Paper template in Metanorma

== General

Technical Papers have no set structure, so organize the content as best fits your purposes

== Content

This GitHub repository contains the content for an OGC Technical Paper.

* `document.adoc` - the main Technical Paper document with references to all sections
* remaining ``adoc``s - each section of the Technical Paper document is in a separate document
** follow directions in each document to populate
* `figures` - figures go here
* `images` - Image files for graphics go here. Image files for figures go in the `figures` directory. Only place in here images not used in figures (e.g., as parts of tables, as logos, etc.)

== Building

Run `make`.
