Welcome to the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Geotechnical Engineering standardization effort. Much of this effort is being performed in collaboration with buildingSMART International (bSI).

This GitHub repository is the workplace for collection of use cases and identification of existing work on the topic. The repository is public to allow the maximum number of stakeholders to participate in this collection effort.

If you are new to GitHub, instructions on its basic use are provided under [Using GitHub](https://github.com/opengeospatial/Geotech/blob/master/UsingGitHub.md) on this page.

## Repository Contents

### Geotech IE
The [Geotech_IE](https://github.com/opengeospatial/Geotech/Geotech_IE) folder contains resources associated with the OGC Geotech Interoperability Experiment (IE). More information on this IE can be found at the [OGC Geotech IE initiative page](https://www.ogc.org/projects/initiatives/geotechie).

### IDBE Geotech
The [IDBE_Geotech](https://github.com/opengeospatial/Geotech/IDBE_Geotech) folder contains contains content from workshops and subsequent work performed as part of the joint OGC-bSI Integrated Digital Built Environment group.
